"the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from Ca". 
This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983)[18] and was first used in December 1983.

The name comes from C's ++ operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a common naming convention of using "+" to indicate an enhanced computer program.
